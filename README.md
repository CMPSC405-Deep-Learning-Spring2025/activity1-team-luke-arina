# Activity1

## Due: 9am on January 17, 2025

### Objectives

- Build intuition for the structure and function of neural networks.
- Understand how data flows through a network and is transformed by weights and activations.
- Recognize the importance of tuning weights and model design in achieving meaningful results.

### Tasks

1. Working in a group of 2-3, select an application for a neural network and come up with a list of mock "features" (e.g., income, credit score, debt-to-income ratio).

Example: A neural network must decide whether to approve loan applications with features including income, credit score, debt-to-income ratio.

2. Build a Physical Neural Network Model
   
Build a mini neural network for your application:

- Use sticky notes or cards for inputs (e.g., "feature 1: 2, feature 2: 5").
- Assign initial weights randomly.
- Connect inputs to hidden neurons with "weights" written on cards/notes.
- Assign each neuron a simple activation function, such as a threshold (e.g., "Output 1 if sum > 5, else 0").

2. Simulate Data Flow
   
- Feed example data through your network.
- Multiply inputs by weights, sum the results, and apply the activation function at each neuron.
- Pass the output to the next layer.

Take turns performing calculations to simulate the network.

4. Group Discussion and Refinement
   
Discuss how your network performed. Did the network's output make sense?
How could you adjust weights or activation functions to improve accuracy?

Can you try to add another layer or modify your model and see its effects?

6. Report 

Following given prompts, report on the performance of your network and your reflection on the activity in the `writing/reflection.md`. A single commit from one team member is sufficient as long as all team member names are included.
