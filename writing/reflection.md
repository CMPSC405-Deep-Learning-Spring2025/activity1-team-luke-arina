## Names: TODO

### Performance

Did the network's output make sense?
How could you adjust weights or activation functions to improve accuracy?
What did you notice about how small changes (e.g., weights) affect outcomes?

### Ethics

What potential biases or ethical considerations could arise in your example scenario?

### Reflection

What was easy to understand about the neural network?
What challenges did they face?
